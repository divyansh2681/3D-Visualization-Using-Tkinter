Neocis Software Assessment - Divyansh Agrawal

This repository has the code for Neocis Software Assessment. The work belongs to Divyansh Agrawal (dagrawa1@umd.edu, divyanshagarwal81@gmail.com). He is a master's in robotics student at the University of Maryland - College Park. This code is written in Python3. It uses the pygame library (requires installation) and Tkinter (already installed along with Python3). Please check the "Neocis Software Assessment - Concepts.pdf" for understanding the concepts.

Installing dependencies:
--run the bash file requirements.sh by executing the command "./requirements.sh" in the terminal

OR 

(manual installation)
--run the command "python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user" in the terminal

Running the program:
--extract the zip file in your desired directory
--navigate to the Part_1 folder, this folder has part1_tk.py and utils_p1.py
--open a terminal in this directory
--make sure all the dependencies are installed 
--make sure you have the input file in the same directory, if not then change the fileName variable in "part1_tk.py"
--fileName should have the path to the input file
--run the command "python3 part1_tk.py"
--to run the project for a different input file, change the fileName variable in the "part1_tk.py"
(Similarly for part2)

When you run the program, the object will spawn on the top left corner. Please click and drag the mouse on the canvas to get the object on the center of the screen.
